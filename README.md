# Virtual Business Card (Version 1.01)

## Background 
A lot of business owners deire to have business cards to give to people expecially potential clients but it is too costly to print out and sometimes, it just get exhausted when you need it the most. And most times, it get lost during other activities. I have been there before :)

## Solution
Here is my solution to that struggle => A virtual business card. 

With this virtual business card, all you need to do is share your link with the potential client, and they get to see all your details (Name, Company/Business Name, Email, Address, etc). You can even add your full website if you have one.

## Functionalities
I added little functionalities to make the user/client interract with the card
  - Logo Hover: When you hover over the logo, it grows in size and the transition is smooth.
  - Logo Click: When you click on the logo, it takes you to the company's full website
  - Phone Number Button: To display your phone number, the user will have to click on a button
  - Social Logos: When the user clicks on a social media logo, it takes them to the business' social media page

## Sample
Below is a snapshot of the of the virtual business card which can be customized on request.

## Future Plans

In the nearest future, a higher version will be developed where users will be allowed to customize the cards and generate a link.
